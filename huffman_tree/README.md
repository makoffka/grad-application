# Huffman Tree Assignment

For this assignment I was given following files:
- [HuffmanGUI.java](HuffmanGUI.java) - this is an interface that was provided by the professor

I have completed the assignment for an application of encoding and decoding text files by applying Huffman algorithm. Core functionality of the application is based on the implementation of Binary Search Trees:
- [HuffmanNode.java](HuffmanNode.java)
- [HuffmanTree.java](HuffmanTree.java)
